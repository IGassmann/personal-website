I’ve been studying the past weeks the OpenAPI specification and the tools around it. I'm using it as
a solution for bringing a REST API closer to continuous delivery.

The mentioned API lacks automated testing. Contract testing is the first sane step towards achieving
continuous delivery. Thanks to OpenAPI and its tool ecosystem, it can generate contract tests.

The strategy consists of first having contract testing to have more confidence when changing the
code and to prepare the ground for a large-scale refactoring.

The following step would be to figure out the new architecture and continuously refactor it starting
from the domain layer while applying TDD. It’s important that this is an incremental and continuous
effort in order to not stop our ability to add features to our product.

The idea is to gradually increase the testing coverage with fast unit tests to turn our
