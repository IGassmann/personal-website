This is the stack I would use if I would build a new MVP at this moment.

The MVP in mind is any web and mobile application. The idea is to have tools that don’t have a steep learning curve and let you focus on the essential: **releasing your MVP**.

The choices have been influenced by my experience of building a [startup](https://odeon.tv/) in a remote environment during the past two years.

Let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/i_gassmann) what would be your preferred MVP stack for an application or what you would change on my.
