A few months ago I applied for my dream job. A Product Engineer role at a startup named
[Stir](https://usestir.com/). I researched all I could find about them and applied like everyone
else through their job application form. After a few steps in the job application process, the
conversation started to die off. I followed up for weeks, but I wouldn’t get any more replies. I
started to give up and went looking for other jobs. But I couldn't get that job off my mind. I felt
like I hadn't tried everything I could. So I went looking for advice.

I shared my experience with the people at [Praxis](https://discoverpraxis.com/) and
[Crash](https://crash.co/), and they persuaded me to keep trying until I hadn't a clear negative
answer. They also suggested I record a video.

So I started drafting a script and made sure to follow the
[tips from Crash to make a great video pitch](https://crash.co/content/how-to-make-a-great-video-pitch/).
After two days of work, the video was ready. But it wasn’t enough for showing that I could do the
job they required.

I wanted to prove that I could easily learn their tech stack and follow their coding style. So I
started dissecting [their website](https://usestir.com/) to uncover what technologies they used, how
they structured their page, what naming conventions they followed, and how they styled their
components. In less than a week, I built a website that mirrored theirs and used it as a pitch for
the job. I hosted the video on it, added extra details about me, made the code
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/IGassmann/stir-pitch-website), and published it at
[igor4stir.com](https://igor4stir.com/).

I followed up once more through email but this time with the website. I also shared it on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/i_gassmann/status/1384219211673739268),
[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26867369), and
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/igassmann_igor-stir-activity-6789999753825443842-eEFI) to
get more visibility to the website and the company as well.

A pitch like this isn’t only good marketing for me, but also for Stir. It shows to others how great
the company must be for someone to take on such an effort to get the opportunity to work with them.

No need to say that this time I got a reply. However, since they only hired in the US, I wasn’t able
to get the job. But actions like such never go unnoticed. They help you
[build your brand](https://igassmann.me/post/new-brand) and show how driven you are.

Although I didn’t get the job, the website helped me to be accepted into
[On Deck First 50 Fellowship](https://www.beondeck.com/first-50) which I’m sure will help me get my
next dream job. I’m super excited to be joining the On Deck community. I’ve seen amazing talents
accelerate their careers with their programs. Stir’s founders themselves have
[met through the On Deck Fellowship](https://www.beondeck.com/case-studies/stir)!

This whole project shows that with just a week of work you can turn a boring job application into an
exciting marketing campaign that could not only get you the job but also help you develop your
brand.

If you don't have the skills to build a website yourself, you can easily build one on
[Crash](https://crash.co/). On Crash, you can build a pitch for your dream job.
