I'm a co-founder of Odeon. We're building the next video platform for independent content creators. There I work as a developer and on operations.

When I’m not developing, I can be found thinking about philosophy. I also love to learn and discuss about politics and economics.

Two key values in my life, are flexibility and accountability. These are essential to achieve personal growth without some worthless obstacles. Beyond that, I believe that one must pursue one’s path with reason and an open mind if he wants to rise into a fulfilled life.
