## Introduction

I'm a product and DevOps engineer with a passion for startups.

I started working 8 years ago at 16 after moving out from my parents’ house in Brazil to pursue a
career in software engineering in Switzerland. There I’ve built web and mobile applications, and
designed network and server infrastructures.

Five years later, I graduated from an entrepreneurship bootcamp and jumped from being an intern at a
[US startup](https://lbry.com/) to being a founder of [one](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/odeon).
We raised about 1M dollars and shipped a [consumer product for video content creators](https://odeon.tv/).

I believe startups are the best place to be for building a product that customers love so much that
they are the ones promoting it the most.

I enjoy being surrounded by people who are always questioning and curious. Who appreciate products
that have been done with a deep concern for quality. Not only at the superficial level, but also
behind the scenes.
