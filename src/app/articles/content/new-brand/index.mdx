After reading [How to Market Yourself](https://www.swyx.io/marketing-yourself/) by
[swyx](https://www.swyx.io/about/), I got inspired to revamp my online presence starting with the
visual aspects of my brand.

I identified two key components of my online brand: social profiles (Twitter, GitHub, LinkedIn,
Facebook…), and my website. I noticed that I wasn’t being consistent across them. I had two
different profile pictures and different bios across the platforms.

## Social Profiles

The most important part for my social profiles — besides posting content — was to use a **consistent
profile picture**. A profile picture works like a company logo. You want it to be easily recognized.

I wanted to have my face on it because faces attract user attention as they do for
[YouTube video thumbnails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPX4PiwQz0U).

For identifying what kind of profile picture I needed, I **scanned through all profile pictures of
the people I follow on Twitter**. The profiles I follow are more likely to match my branding
preferences and my targeted audience. I selected 18 of them in a moodboard and highlighted the ones
that caught my attention the most.

I noticed that **bright pictures with a zoomed-in face and a high contrast with the background**
were the most eye-catching ones. So I calculated the opposite colors of my skin to identify the
ideal background color for my picture.

<Image src={profilePictureColors} alt="Profile Picture Colors" className="mx-auto w-60" />

Then I found a scenario that matched the color and took some pictures of myself with the help of my
girlfriend. Finally, with
[macOS Photos](https://support.apple.com/guide/photos/editing-basics-pht304c2ace6/6.0/mac/11.0), I
edited the picture to make it brighter and more colorful.

## Personal Website

I already had an existing website made with the Gatsby starter,
[Lumen](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen). However, it was devoided of a
distinct visual identity and was missing some features I wanted to add.

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) did well its job as a static site generator. But I wanted to
take the oportunity to move to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), which is my
[preferred framework for web apps](/articles/2020-mvp-stack).

Before designing the website, I began the work by identifying my goals and target audience:

- **Sell myself to potential employers**: startup founders
- **Build an audience of readers**: startup founders and influencers

From the goals, I listed the associated features:

- **Sell myself to potential employers**: startup founders
  - About page
    - Bio
    - Tech Skills
  - Portfolio page
  - Profile picture
  - Startup-oriented branding
- **Build an audience of readers**: startup founders and influencers
  - RSS support
  - Commenting
  - Post sharing
    - Hacker News
    - Twitter
    - Reddit
    - LinkedIn
    - Facebook
  - Topics
    - #technology
    - #startups
    - #liberty
    - #ethics
    - #culture
    - #content-creation

With that, I had a clear image of what I wanted for my website.

### Design

As I did for my profile picture, I put together a moodboard. I looked for websites that had a
cyberpunk feeling which was the esthetic that I had an affinity for my brand.

<Image src={websiteMoodboard} alt="Website Moodboard" />

Then I inspected the fonts and colors of the websites to help me choose the ones for my own. With
all of that, I was able to define the colors and typography of my website.

<Image
  src={styleguide}
  alt="Styleguide"
  className="rounded-md border-4 border-zinc-900 bg-zinc-900"
/>

I had everything I needed to fully design the website. I started by designing the desktop mockups on
[Figma](https://figma.com/) since I expected my website to be primarily accessed on desktop.

I made sure to effectively use all useful Figma features such as
[Auto layout](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040451373-Create-dynamic-designs-with-Auto-layout),
[components](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038662654-Guide-to-Components-in-Figma)
and, [styles](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039238753-Styles-in-Figma). After a few
days of work, I had my all my mockups ready and filled with content for desktop, table, and mobile.

<FigmaFile url="https://www.figma.com/file/dBF5UcvvdzhuzEd4ZYTgux/?node-id=0%3A1" />

With the mockups, I built the
[prototypes](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040314193-Guide-to-prototyping-in-Figma)
that I shared with some trusted friends to receive early-feedback.

Finally, I made a design system and published all the
[designs on Zeplin](https://scene.zeplin.io/project/605ca4ee92a33101a2c90ac4) for development
handoff.

### Development

For the first iteration of my website, I wanted to have it available in a week. So I decided to cut
development features such as TypeScript and tests. The website didn't have much complexity. I wasn’t
expecting many bugs while developing.

I started by implementing the
[layout components](https://github.com/IGassmann/personal-website/tree/0c66e1d164efac2df32508ec33312e3cfa28fb3d/src/layouts)
and the global SCSS code. Then I worked on a page-by-page basis until arriving at the
[posts page](https://github.com/IGassmann/personal-website/blob/main/src/pages/post/%5BpostSlug%5D.js).
This page contains the
[Post component](https://github.com/IGassmann/personal-website/blob/0c66e1d164efac2df32508ec33312e3cfa28fb3d/src/components/Post/Post.js),
which uses `react-markdown` with a few
[custom renderers](https://github.com/IGassmann/personal-website/blob/0c66e1d164efac2df32508ec33312e3cfa28fb3d/src/lib/markdownRenderers.js)
for rendering the content written in Markdown.

One of the renderers I implemented uses `remark-directives` for defining shortcodes such as for
embedding Figma files in my posts:

**Figma Shortcode**

```
::figma{url='https://www.figma.com/file/dBF5UcvvdzhuzEd4ZYTgux/?node-id=65%3A0'}
```

**Shortcodes Handler**

```js
leafDirective: ({ attributes, name }) => {
  if (name === 'figma') {
    return (
      <iframe
        allowFullScreen
        src={`https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=${attributes.url}`}
      />
    );
  }
};
```

In a couple of days, I was able to fully implement the website and deploy it on
[Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

I made the website [public on GitHub](https://github.com/IGassmann/personal-website) for any
interested person to access the implementation details.

### Future Improvements

There are still many features and code quality enhancements I want to bring to the codebase that
would make the codebase exemplar. I will be adding these in my free time. For now, I'm listing them
on the website's
[README.md file](https://github.com/IGassmann/personal-website/blob/main/README.md).

- Migrate to [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- Set up [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/),
  [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/), and
  [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)
- Set up [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
- Add tests
- Migrate to [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Add share buttons for posts
- Add commenting feature
- Add "Edit on GitHub" button to pages
- Set up git-based CMS [Forestry](https://forestry.io/)
- Set up a newsletter

## Final Brand

With the website done, I re-used its visual identity on my social profiles.

<Image src={twitterProfile} alt="Twitter Profile" className="mx-auto w-96" />

Now there was only one missing piece and also the most important: **content**.

To complete my new brand, I need to keep consistently producing content on my blog and social media.
