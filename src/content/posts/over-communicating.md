Thereâ€™s something that my life keeps remembering me. The value of communicating. I would even say
the value of over-communicating. Even though over implies too much communication, I believe that is
rarely the case.

- Over-communicate how you feel to your loved ones;
- Over-communicate to your co-workers;
- Over-communicate to your audience;
- ...

The idea of communicating goes hands in hands with the principle of **telling the truth** and
**transparency**.
