Here are the resources I believe one should consume when getting into Test-Driven Development,
a.k.a. TDD:

- [TDD & The Lump Of Coding Fallacy](https://www.geepawhill.org/2018/04/14/tdd-the-lump-of-coding-fallacy/)
- [The Art of Agile Development: Test-Driven Development](https://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/test_driven_development.html)
- [Mocks Aren't Stubs](https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html)
- [Workflows of Refactoring](https://martinfowler.com/articles/workflowsOfRefactoring/)

If you have any other resource you believe should part of this list, tweet me it.
